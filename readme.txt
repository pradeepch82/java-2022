                                    Hello Pradeep

                      Static Content:  Hello
                      Dynamic Content : Pradeep,Saurabh


2.Service Layer /Business Logic Layer :
                         It is a logical implementation of business rules.

                            class Bank{

                                         fundTransfer(int source,int dest,int amount){

                                           //if source exists && dest exists && amount to be transfered is leass than avaiable bance
                                           //debit the source account by amount
                                           //credit the destinatio account by amount
                                          //commit the changes in database
                                          //dsisplay the successfull message
                                         else
                                          //display error Problem in transfering the fund   
                          
                                      }
                 }

                                      



3.Data Access Layer
                    The code written to access the data from DataSource is called as Data Access Layer.

R -  Read/Retrieve the record
U -  Update the record 
D -  Delete the record


          
4.Data Layer


Layer   : Logical separation of the code.

           1 tier application
           2 tier application
           3 tier application
           n tier application
